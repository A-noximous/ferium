# Ferium

Ferium is an open source and easy to use package manager for Minecraft mods on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com) and [Github Releases](https://github.com/releases). Simply add the mods you use (through the CLI or config file) and in just one command, you can download all the mods and update existing ones.

## Feature to do

I hope to implement all the following improvements, preferably in the order listed. No gaurantees though.

- [x] Allow configuration through a CLI
- [x] Add support for downloading from Github releases
- [ ] Add proper error handling with descriptive error messages
- [ ] Coloured terminal output
- [ ] Add support for checking mod loader and Minecraft version compatibility
- [ ] Release the Labrinth library as a seperate Crate
- [ ] Add support for downloading from CurseForge (Might need help for this one)
