# Ferium

Ferium is a package manager like program for Minecraft mods (that are on Modrinth). You can add mods by finding your mods on Modrinth, specifying their project IDs in the config file, and running the command. Ferium will download the latest version of each mod in the config. It replaces (i.e. overwrites) any older downloads.

## Feature TODO

- [ ] Check that the version is compatible with a specified Minecraft version
- [ ] Allow configuration through a CLI
- [ ] Release the Labrinth library as a seperate Crate
- [ ] Add support for downloading from Github releases
- [ ] Add support for downloading from CurseForge
